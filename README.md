# Nero - A Terminal-Based Text Editor (Learning Project)

Nero is a simple, terminal-based text editor created as a personal learning project to explore the fundamentals of building text editors and deepen my understanding of Go. It provides basic editing functionality and demonstrates core text editor features.

## Features

- **Basic Text Editing**: Supports simple text insertion, deletion, and navigation.
- **Line Numbers**: Displays line numbers for easy reference.
- **Status Bar**: Shows file name, modification state, and cursor position.
- **File Management**: Open, edit, and save text files within the terminal.

## Purpose

Nero is not intended for practical use as a daily text editor. It is purely a project for personal learning and experimentation in building terminal UIs and understanding the basics of text editors in Go.
